MiraCloud is a desktop app that offers an AWS user a chance to visualize all of their services in a specific region or in all of them at once. The user-friendly interface allows the user to launch, delete, run and stop an instance of services like EC2, RDS and S3 buckets. It also creates and deletes connections between security groups of those instances. 

## Getting Started
- [ ] Clone the repo.
`git clone *github url` or use SSH 
- [ ] Go to directory and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to bundle your Electron application
- [ ] Run `npm start` to start MiraCloud

## Login
The login interface securely handles the user's IAM keys by saving into a hidden folder and deleting it upon logout.
1. Set up a new IAM user on your AWS console: Make sure you keep your aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key by downloading the .csv file.
2. Give permissions to AWS IAM User. 
	For read, write, and delete, you can give permission by:

		AmazonEC2FullAccess
		AmazonRDSFullAccess
		AmazonS3FullAccess
		AWSLambdaFullAccess

	For viewing only, you can give permissions by:

		AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess
		AmazonRDSReadOnlyAccess
		AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
		AWSLambdaReadOnlyAccess


	The user will use their public and secret key generated by creating a new IAM user on their AWS account. Once signed in,  if the keys are real, the user will choose whether they want to see their instances in one or in all regions.

## Choosing a region
The user will be able to see all instances of EC2, RDS, S3 and lambda functions they might have. You can either create or delete instances in all or specific region by using the buttons located in the right side-panel.

## Node Details
Once a node is clicked, the user can see the data on the instance selected.

## Configure security groups
Editing security groups through AWS is unclear for many users that do not regularly use the AWS dashboard. With the navigatable UI provided by MiraCloud, the user can click on a particular instance to get all data associated with it. In addition to viewing this data, inbound and outbound rules for security groups can be effortlessly changed and these changes will be seen by the user.
